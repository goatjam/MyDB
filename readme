MyDB.php v1.0 - A simple mysql persistence class for PHP

Copyright Brett Glasson <brett.glasson@zoho.com> 2018

I created this for my own personal use because I didn't want to
use the more complicated persistence frameworks such as symfony or
doctrine. If your project is very large you probably dont want to
use this, otherwise enjoy!
